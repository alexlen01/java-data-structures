# Strings

A string can be viewed as a special kind of array, namely one made out of characters. String are treated separately from arrays because certain operations, which are commonly applied to strings -- for example, comparison, joining, splitting, searching for substrings, replacing one string with another, parsing -- do not make sense for general arrays.
